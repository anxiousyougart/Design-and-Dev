From Figma to Website 🌐
Welcome to our Web Development project! 🚀

In this repository, you'll find how we turned a sleek Figma design into a fully functional website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

What is Web Development?
Web development is all about creating websites and web apps for the internet. It combines:

HTML: For structuring the content (like headings, text, images).
CSS: For styling (making it look pretty and responsive).
JavaScript: For adding interactivity (like buttons, forms, or animations).

Our Process 🛠️
Design: Started with a polished Figma prototype.
Structure: Used HTML to build the skeleton of the site.
Style: Added colors, fonts, and layouts with CSS to match the design.
Interact: Implemented cool features and functionality with JavaScript.
