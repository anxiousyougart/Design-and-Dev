# From Figma to Website üåê  

Welcome to our **Web Development** project!   

In this repository, you'll find how we turned a sleek **Figma design** into a fully functional website using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  

## What is Web Development?  
Web development is all about creating websites and web apps for the internet. It combines:  
- **HTML**: For structuring the content (like headings, text, images).  
- **CSS**: For styling (making it look pretty and responsive).  
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity (like buttons, forms, or animations).  

## Our Process üõ†Ô∏è  
1. **Design**: Started with a polished **Figma prototype**.  
2. **Structure**: Used **HTML** to build the skeleton of the site.  
3. **Style**: Added colors, fonts, and layouts with **CSS** to match the design.  
4. **Interact**: Implemented cool features and functionality with **JavaScript**.
